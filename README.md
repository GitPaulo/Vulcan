# Overview

**Vulcan** is a multi-purpose discord bot built with [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). Vulcan's goal is to enhance the environment within our discord server. Note that its design and features are exclusively tailored to our needs.

This project is maintained only by a few people, but you are welcome to join!

# Invite Vulcan

Vulcan's features are **disabled by default** on **new guilds**; they must be activated by one of the bot owners.

Note that this is **intended**. Once Vulcan is invited to a new server, an automatic request to enable its features on the new guild is sent to the bot owners. You may also use the `authorise` command to manually send a request.

To invite Vulcan to your discord server simply click the image link below:

5. Run the following command: `npm ci && npm run exec:components`.
6. Navigate to the new `'settings'` folder and fill in the required configuration & credentials details.
7. After updating the default settings, run the following command: `npm start`.
