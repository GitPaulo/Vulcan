# Overview

**Vulcan** is a multi-purpose discord bot built with [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). Vulcan was created to acomplish the tasks of administration, utility and entertainment for the discord server of our group of friends and, as such, its design and features are tailored to our needs.
  
The project is maintained by only a few people, but you are welcome to join.

# Invite Vulcan

Vulcan's features are **disabled by default** on __new guilds__: they must be activated by one of the bot owners.

Note that this is **intended**. Once Vulcan is invited to a new server an automatic request to enable its features on the new guild is sent to the bot owners. You may also use the `authorise` command to manually send a request.

To invite Vulcan to your discord server simply click the image link below:

# Self Hosting

Make sure you have updated versions of your host machine's OS services and follow these steps:

1. Download and install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
2. Download and install [python (v2.x)](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Download and install [node & npm (stable)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
    
    2.1. If on Linux machine we recommend using [NVM](https://stackabuse.com/using-nvm-to-install-node/).
4. Clone repository using [git](https://git-scm.com/) OR Download and extract the [zipped repository code](https://github.com/GitPaulo/Vulcan.git).
5. Open a [shell](https://git-scm.com/downloads) in the location of directory of the extraced zip.
6. Run the following command: `npm ci && npm test`.
7. Navigate to the new `'settings/'` folder and fill in the required configuration & credentials details.
8. Afterwards, run the following command: `sudo npm run production`.
9. If using the webhook server. Make sure port 443 is open. (or use a service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/))

## Supported Platforms

The master branch uses node-opus. **Unlike** the production branch. (compatibility issues - soon to be fixed)
Because of the use of node-opus, the bot can only be hosted in the following platforms:

- Linux x64 & ia32
- Linux ARM (Raspberry Pi 1 & 2)
- Linux ARM64 (Raspberry Pi 3)
- Mac OS X x64
- Windows x64

It is possible for compatibility with other OSs but that requires node-opus installation tinkering.

More information can be found in the [node-opus repository.](https://github.com/Rantanen/node-opus)
